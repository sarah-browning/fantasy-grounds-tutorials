      <p>
        Have you watched that famous group of "<a href="http://www.critrole.com">nerdy ass voice
        actors</a>" that play D&D on Twitch every Thursday and thought it looked fun?  Maybe you've
        been looking for new ways to engage with your friends and family in a socially distant
        manner? Just always wanted to give D&D a try but couldn't find local friends to play with?
        Then you're in the right place!
      </p>

      <p>
        Dungeons & Dragons has seen a massive resurgence over the past few years due largely in part to
        the rise of streaming combined with the user friendliness of the 5th Edition ruleset released
        by <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite> in 2014.  Alongside this explosion of growth, a plethora
        of digital and online tools have emerged to aid in bringing tabletop games online and connecting
        players around the world.  From dice rollers and character sheet generators to map-making tools,
        soundboards and token creators to fully-fledged virtual tabletop programs, it has never been
        easier to start playing D&D.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is one of these virtual tabletop programs, Fantasy Grounds, that I'm going to introduce you to
        here. I've got a quick tutorial about how to create your first character in Fantasy Grounds when
        you're new to the program.  Along the way, we'll learn some of the basics of using Fantasy Grounds
        as a player, including how to customize your dice.  I want to also mention a few important things
        to note before we get started:
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is very important that the game master and all players are running the same version of
            Fantasy Grounds, and the easiest way to ensure this is to have everyone click on "Check for
            Updates" before each game session.
          </li>
          <li>
            You'll need a copy of your character on the Gm's hosted server in order to play.  To that
            end, this tutorial is going to assume that we are already connected to a server and creating
            a character for use in play.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will also be using the official D&D theme, so it's possible that your Fantasy Grounds
            tabletop may look slightly different depending on the theme your GM has chosen.  All the
            buttons should still be the same.
          </li>
        </ul>
        I'll be writing out instructions and including a short video for each step so you can see the
        process in action.  So let's get started!
      </p>
    </div>

  <main>        <!-- Tutorial Starts -->

      <div class="text-container">
        <p>
        The first thing we need to do is activate the modules we'll be using to create our character.
        To do this, we'll click on <b>Library</b> and then <b>Modules</b>.  The list of modules you
        see will vary depending on what your DM has made available to you. Click <b>Load</b> on any
        modules you want to use.  You may need to wait a few seconds, but it'll be ready when the
        image of a book opens.  We're just going to open the Player's Handbook.  While we're here,
        we'll also select the <b>"Create PC"</b> layout from the Library tab to change our buttons
        to character creation relevant ones.  This will help out in a moment.
        </p>
      </div>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TgjIx2abSRs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="flex-container2">
      <img src="fgtuts_step2.png" alt="Step 2: Name and Ability Scores">
    </div>

    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="text-container">
        <p>
          The next thing we'll do is create a blank character sheet to start editing.  If you click
          on the button for <b>PCs</b> in the right-hand bar, a new window will open up showing any
          character sheets you have access to.  This is also how you will access your PC at the start
          of any game.  For now, let's click on the Green + button to add a new item.  A blank
          character sheet will open, and you'll notice that a blank square appears in the upper left
          corner of the screen. The first thing to do is enter a name for your character.  You can do
          this later, but it makes it easy to find in the list of PCs in the event that you close out.
          Now that we have our scores in, we can begin creating the character in full.  For this
          tutorial, we're going to create a sheet for Caelynn Kethaera, a <b>Wood Elf Ranger</b>.
          We're going to select the <b>Outlander</b> background, and give her a longbow and some
          starting equipment.  As we go, you'll see the information on tabs such as Main, Skills,
          Abilities, Inventory, Notes, and Actions begin to fill out from Fantasy Grounds' automation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, we're going to enter our character's ability scores to the sheet.  In Fantasy
          Grounds, it's important to make sure we do this before adding other elements to the sheet
          so that bonuses from racials or character skills calculate properly.  To add an ability
          score, simply click in the box for the appropriate score and type in the value.  There
          are several different ways to calculate your ability scores.  The most popular are using the
          standard array, point buy, or rolling four six-sided dice and dropping the lowest.  We'll go
          ahead and use the standard array for this tutorial, which is <em><b>8, 10, 12, 14, 15, and
          16</b></em>.  For Caelynn, we'll assign the 8 to her STR, 16 to DEX, 14 to CON, 12 to INT,
          15 to WIS, and 10 to CHA.  As you enter your scores, you may notice the numbers for your
          AC, Init and Saves changing.  This is normal.
        </p>

    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="text-container">
        <p>
          One of the reasons for Fantasy Grounds' popularity is because of the automation it offers, and
          character creation is no different.  Much of the chracter creation is handled through drag and
          dropping elements onto the character sheet, and the program then fills out what is needed.
          Fantasy Grounds is a really robust program, and if you're not sure what you want your character
          to be, you may want to spend some time looking and reading through the options.  The modules
          include all of the same information that is in the official source books, it just also includes
          a bunch of automation to work within the program and make things easier.  For character
          creation, I like to start with <b>Race</b> followed by <b>Background</b> and finally, <b>Class</b>.
          You can access these sections by clicking on the appropriate buttons in the right-hand bar,
          and then selecting hte option you're interested in reading more about.  Once you've made a
          selection, simply click on the red dragon icon (sometimes a shield icon in other themes) beside
          the selection, and dragging that to the appropriate section of the character sheet.  If the
          selection you made requires a sub-selection, a small window will autoamtically pop up giving
          you options to choose from.  In the below video, you'll see this happen for a subrace when we
          choose our race, and again for skills when we select our class.

      <div class="text-container">
        <p>
          The next thing to do is add some starting equipment, including a weapon, armor and backpack kit.
          You can add these from the <b>Items</b> button on the right-hand bar.  If you know what you're
          looking for, you can simply search it, or you can scroll through the lists until you see something
          you like.  We'll add a longbow, some studed leather armor, and an explorer's pack.  In the case
          of items, we'll need to switch tabs on the character sheet to the Inventory tab and drop our
          items there.  In the case of weapons, they will automatically add an action to the Actions
          tab on the character sheet, so you can later roll your attack and damage rolls.  If you drop a
          pack, such as our Explorer's Pack on the Inventory page, it will add everything that in included
          in that pack automatically, saving heaps of time by not requiring you to find each individual item
          included.

      <div class="text-container">
        <p>
          We're nearly done.  The very last thing to do is select a character portrait to represent your
          character in the game.  We do this by clicking on the blank icon near our name.  This will bring
          up a window with a selection of bags.  Hovering over each one will tell you what collection
          they include, and you can double click to delve deeper in and see the options.  When you find
          one that you like, simply double click and it will show up in the upper left portion of your
          character sheet, as well as in the upper left section of the screen.  You can also import your
          own portraits, but we'll cover how to do that in another tutorial.  For our purposes today,
          we'll select one of the already installed portraits.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's your first character created in Fantasy Grounds!  Congratulations.  I know the program
          can feel overwhelming at first, but it's really not so bad once you get used to it.  As a bonus,
          I'll also show you how to customize the color of your dice so you can stand out from the rest of
          your party.

        <p>
          Everyone likes to have their own dice, and you can customize the color of yours so they show up in
          the chat differently from everyone elses.  To do so, you're going to click on the Colors button,
          which shows up as an artist's palette in the mini-buttons at the top of the right-hand bar.  A new
          window will open showing your current dice color in the middle, surrounded by various sized circles
          of red, blue, green, white, and black.  Clicking on these colored circles will add either a lot,
          some, or a little of that color to the dice color.  Play around until you like the color in the
          center and then click the X to close the window.  There is also a circle marked with a T, which
          will switch the text on your dice to either white or black.  As you make changes, you'll see your
          dice change in real time.  Adding white or black can brighten or darken the color as you wish.
